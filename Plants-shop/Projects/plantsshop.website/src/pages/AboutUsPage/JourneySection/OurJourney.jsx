            Welcome to GreenGlow, where our passion for plants drives everything
            we do. Our story began with a simple love for nature and has grown
            into a mission to bring the beauty and benefits of plants to homes
            everywhere. Each plant we offer is nurtured with care and expertise,
            ensuring it thrives and transforms your space.
